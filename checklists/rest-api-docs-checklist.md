# REST API Documentation Checklist

My following REST API checklist is specifically tailored for REST API documentation. It focuses on the essential components required when documenting REST APIs, such as endpoints, authentication, request/response formats, and error codes.

If you're working with other APIs (like GraphQL, SOAP, or WebSocket APIs), the checklist will need to be adjusted to include their unique documentation requirements. 

Before publishing your REST API docs, remember to document each of the following items.

---

## 1. **General Information**

- [ ] **REST API Name**: Is the API name clearly stated at the top of your document?
- [ ] **Base URL**: Is the base URL for all API requests included (e.g., `https://api.sitecore.com/v1`)?
- [ ] **Versioning**: Is the API version documented? (e.g., `v1`, `v2`)
- [ ] **Date of Last Update**: Is the last date of documentation update mentioned?

---

## 2. **Authentication**

- [ ] **Authentication Type**: Is the authentication method (API key, OAuth, etc.) clearly explained?
- [ ] **Authorization Headers**: Are instructions provided for including the API key or token in the headers?
- [ ] **Example Authentication**: Is there an example showing how to authenticate a request (e.g., a sample header with API key)?

---

## 3. **Endpoints and Methods**

Document the following per each endpoint:

- [ ] **Endpoint Path**: Is the exact URL path of the endpoint provided (e.g., `/resources`)?
- [ ] **HTTP Methods**: Are the supported HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) specified?
- [ ] **Request Parameters**: Are the required and optional parameters for the request detailed, including:
  - [ ] Parameter name
  - [ ] Type (e.g., string, integer)
  - [ ] Required/optional
  - [ ] Description of what the parameter does
  - [ ] Default value, if applicable
- [ ] **Example Requests**: Are examples of requests included (with real or mock data)?
- [ ] **Example Responses**: Are example responses provided for both success and failure cases?

---

## 4. **Response Structure**

- [ ] **Response Format**: Is the response format (e.g., JSON, XML) clearly stated?
- [ ] **Fields in Response**: Are the fields in the response detailed, including:
  - [ ] Field name
  - [ ] Type (e.g., string, integer, array)
  - [ ] Description of what the field represents
- [ ] **Success Responses**: Are examples of successful responses provided for each endpoint?
- [ ] **Error Responses**: Are error responses explained with codes and error messages?

---

## 5. **Error Handling**

- [ ] **HTTP Status Codes**: Are all possible HTTP status codes listed and explained (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`)?
- [ ] **Error Messages**: Are detailed error messages included for each potential error?
- [ ] **Troubleshooting**: Are troubleshooting tips provided for common error codes or issues (e.g., authentication errors, missing parameters)?

---

## 6. **Rate Limiting and Pagination**

- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Is rate limiting explained (e.g., 100 requests per minute)? Are any headers or responses related to rate limiting described?
- [ ] **Pagination**: If applicable, is pagination explained (e.g., `limit`, `offset` parameters)?
- [ ] **Example Pagination Requests**: Are examples of requests with pagination parameters included?
- [ ] **Example Paginated Responses**: Are examples of paginated responses provided?

---

## 7. **Additional Features**

- [ ] **Filters**: If filters are available, are they described (e.g., filtering by date, status)?
- [ ] **Sorting**: If the API supports sorting, are the parameters and options documented?
- [ ] **Webhooks (if applicable)**: If webhooks are available, are the webhook events and payloads detailed?

---

## 8. **Code Samples**

- [ ] **Language-Specific Code Samples**: Are code samples provided for common languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, curl)?
- [ ] **Step-by-Step Guides**: Are there step-by-step examples of requesting using the API in different programming languages?

---

## 9. **Error Codes and Troubleshooting**

- [ ] **Common Error Codes**: Are all common API errors and their meanings documented (e.g., `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`)?
- [ ] **Error Code Troubleshooting**: Are solutions or tips provided for resolving common errors?

---

## 10. **Miscellaneous**

- [ ] **Rate Limiting Headers**: Are the headers for rate limits clearly explained (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`)?
- [ ] **Deprecated Endpoints**: If any endpoints are deprecated, is that information mentioned along with alternatives?
- [ ] **Change Log**: Is there a change log or release notes section to track API updates and modifications?

---

## 11. **Documentation Format and Usability**

- [ ] **Clear and Concise Language**: Is the documentation written in plain, understandable language without jargon?
- [ ] **Consistent Terminology**: Is terminology used consistently throughout the documentation?
- [ ] **Headers and Sections**: Are sections organized with appropriate headers for quick navigation?
- [ ] **Searchable**: Is the documentation easily searchable?
- [ ] **Links to Related Documentation**: Are links to related sections (e.g., authentication, error handling) provided for easy reference?

---

## Final Step:

- [ ] **Documentation Review**: Have technical writers and developers reviewed the documentation for accuracy and clarity?
